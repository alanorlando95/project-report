        I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Dr. Paul G. Plöger, for helping me with his “Robot Perception” class 
        to understand essential concepts for accomplishing this project. 
        I would also like to thank my supervisor Dr. Stefan Rilling and Julian Theis, 
        for giving me an introduction to the A-DRZ project at the Fraunhofer IAIS and 
        supporting me with all the necessary information from the A-DRZ project, especially the data needed to evaluate this work. 
        And thanks to my supervisor Alex Mitrevski who always answered my theoretical and technical questions.

        And last but not least, thanks to all my family and my friends, who support me emotionally and economically during this project.
