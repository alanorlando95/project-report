    \section{Setup}
        - The data used to evaluate the approach was collected and provided by different Universities (The University of Bonn, Technical University of Darmstadt). \par
        - Unfortunately, there is no ground truth for the data available. Therefore, the results are evaluated manually by a person who decides whether the registration was successful or not. \par
        - The input to the developed system is a CityGML model together with its corresponding point cloud.
        - The output is the visualization of the CityGML model aligned with its corresponding point cloud.
