    \chapter{Solution}

    Due to the different sources of data and the time by which this was provided, we propose two similar but different solutions to solve this problem.
    The core part of the proposed solutions is a Linear Programming method and they differ in the preprocessing of the data.

    The solution to the problem is to implement the algorithm presented by \cite{Goebbels_2018_linebased} 
    
    - Due to poor data availability, a (deep) learning method is unthinkable to solve the problem: there is not enough data to train a model. \par
    

    \section{Proposed algorithm}
    - The main steps of the algorithm are listed as follows: \par
    - Project the point cloud into the XY plane \par
    - Project the corners of the CityGML Model onto the XY plane \par
    - Identify the corners in the projection of the point cloud onto the XY-plane \par
    - Use Linear Programming to find a transformation that best aligns both projections onto the XY-plane \par
